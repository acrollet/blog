## Getting Started

### About

ZoneFlow is a simple run tracking app for WatchOS focused on helping maintain a given heartrate zone without having to continuously check the display. It taps your wrist with single taps when below the target zone, and double taps when above. It is available on the app store [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zoneflow/id6739025069).

### Compatibility

- Requires watchOS 10.5 or later
- Compatible with Apple Watch Series 4 and newer

### Installation

1. Download ZoneFlow from the App Store
2. Open the app on your Apple Watch
3. Choose a zone and start running!

## Setting Up Your Heart Rate Zones

### Manual Zone Configuration

ZoneFlow defaults to using automatic zones based on your age. To configure custom zones using your personal heart rate data:

1. Tap the gear icon on the start screen
2. Select the "Use Manual Zones" toggle
3. Set minimum and maximum beats per minute for each zone

## Troubleshooting
