## Non-fiction

### [Beaverland](https://share.libbyapp.com/title/8882714) by Leila Philip

A fascinating read about an underappreciated species. Well worth it and might just turn you into a "Beaver Believer".

### [Every Grain of Rice](https://share.libbyapp.com/title/2310274) by Fuchsia Dunlop

Highly recommended - both practical and interesting, giving loads of insight into Chinese cuisine, which is richly varied. (Lumping it all together is somewhat like saying "European Food"!)

### [Training for the Uphill Athlete](https://share.libbyapp.com/title/5371188) by KÃ­lian Jornet Burgada, Scott Johnston, and Steve House

See [On enjoying running]({{< ref "/posts/2024/on-enjoying-running" >}}) for more.

### [How Life Works](https://share.libbyapp.com/title/10172672) by Philip Ball

Our understanding of how biological systems work is constantly evolving, (rimshot!) and I found this to be an in depth but still accessible overview.

### [Paved Paradise](https://share.libbyapp.com/title/9173421) by Henry Grabar

You will not look at parking lots the same way after reading this. (And that's a good thing!)

### [24 Hours in Ancient Rome](https://share.libbyapp.com/title/5327027) by Philip Matyszak

This was recommended on a [podcast with Nat Friedman](https://share.transistor.fm/s/fb838c77) about the [Vesuvius Challenge](https://scrollprize.org) and gives a good flavor of what life in Rome might have been like.

### [The Wrong Stuff](https://share.libbyapp.com/title/10180805) by John Strausbaugh

However shoddy and dangerous you might think the Soviet space program was, it was even worse than that.

### [The Phoenix Project](https://share.libbyapp.com/title/3751102) by Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, and George Spafford

This is the somewhat cheesy novelized DevOps Manifesto that I didn't know I needed. I found it quite inspiring.

## Fiction

### [A Man Called Ove](https://share.libbyapp.com/title/1766162) by Fredrik Backman

Amusing and touching.

### [Dogs of War](https://share.libbyapp.com/title/5563394) by Adrian Tchaikovsky

This was a compelling read by a personal favorite author. Provides a lot of food for thought as LLMs grow rapidly more capable.

### [Delta-v](https://share.libbyapp.com/title/4187784) by Daniel Saurez

A great read, and provides what feels like a semi-realistic (even if probably still understated) understanding of the many dangers of deep space travel.
