I took my first ride in a Waymo earlier this year. It was both remarkable as a new experience, and unremarkable in that it matched most other people's experiences. It felt amazing and futuristic for about five minutes. However, nothing triggered any feeling of unease or lack of safety, and I quickly found myself tempted to reach for my phone.

So, what makes me say that Waymo is basically McDonald's? First off, I should say that this thought is a light veneer on Matt Bell's statement that [the average Waymo is usually at maybe 80th percentile on the Lyft/Uber quality scale](https://www.mattbell.us/what-i-learned-from-130-hours-in-a-waymo/). I believe that the _predictability_ of the Waymo experience is what will drive it to McDonald's-esque levels of market penetration. (And probably into a generic term for a driverless taxi, like Kleenex for tissues) People go into McDonald's because they know what they will get.
